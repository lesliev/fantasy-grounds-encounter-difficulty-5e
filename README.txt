Encounter Difficulty Extension

This extension calculates difficulty live, as an encounter changes. To use it,
download the EncounterDifficulty.ext file and drop it in your Fantasy Grounds
"extensions" directory.

When you start the launcher you should then see "Encounter Difficulty" listed
under extensions. Activate the extension and load into your campaign. Look for
the "Encounter Difficulty Extension loaded" message in chat. If it loaded
properly, open an encounter and adjust it by adding or removing enemies. You
should see some text update in the encounter window that tells you how
difficult the encounter is.

Note that the extension ignores the combat tracker since it assumes you will be
balancing encounters for the full party. So make sure all the party's characters
are in the Party Sheet before you start balancing encounters.

This extension is for Fantasy Grounds DnD 5th edition ruleset. It should work
for both 2014 and 2024 rules - but I don't have the 2024 DMG to double-check
so your feedback is welcome!

Here's a demo of the extension in action:
