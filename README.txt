Encounter Difficulty Extension

This extension calculates difficulty live, as an encounter changes. To use it,
activate the extension and look for the "Encounter Difficulty Extension loaded"
message in chat. If it loaded properly, open an encounter and adjust it by
adding or removing enemies. You should see some text update in the encounter
window that tells you how difficult the encounter is.

Note that the extension ignores the combat tracker since it assumes you will be
balancing encounters for the full party. So make sure the party characters are
all there on the top left before you start balancing encounters.


This extension is for Fantasy Grounds DnD 5th edition ruleset, using 2014 rules.
It should be easy to adapt to other rulesets.
